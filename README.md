# Cisco_IOSdevice_automation
I am creating this repo for those who new to network automation and want to get started with network automation through python.

I have used simple python modules like Getpass and Netmiko in these scripts.

Use my scripts and with those express your programming concepts to do lot with network automation.

Netmiko:
  This module will ssh to your network devices with pre configured username and password and 'not secret'.
  

authuser.py
  This file will make and ssh connection to targeted device and let you know weather the connection us made or not.
  
create_int.py
  This file will help you confiure and interface and after successfull coniguration displays you interface brief.
  Also lets you create Vlan Interface also

sampleconnection.py
  This file will show the ways of establishing a connection to your targeted devices



note:
  These scripts is only work those devices which has ssh enablwed and devices with already configured user with login local mode.
